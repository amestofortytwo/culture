# Culture

At Fortytwo, we believe in the power of open source software to drive innovation and create better technology for everyone. As a company, we are committed to contributing to open source projects and communities in meaningful ways.

## Code Management at Fortytwo

### **Code Management at Fortytwo**

Fortytwo has a rigorous code management process in place to ensure that our software is of the highest quality. Our developers use modern version control systems, such as Git, to manage and track changes to the code. This allows us to easily collaborate on projects, maintain a clear history of changes, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

We also use code review processes to ensure that all changes to our codebase are thoroughly vetted before they are integrated. This not only helps us maintain the quality of our code, but also encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among our developers.

### **Open Source Contributions**

At Fortytwo, we believe in giving back to the open source community that has given us so much. We actively contribute to a variety of open source projects, both by fixing bugs and adding new features, and by releasing some of our own code as open source.

Some of the projects that we have contributed to in the past include:

Python:
We have contributed to the Python programming language itself, helping to fix bugs and improve performance.

Django:
Django is a high-level Python web framework that we use extensively in our own projects. We have contributed bug fixes and new features to the Django project, and continue to be active in the Django community.

Other Open Source Projects:
In addition to our contributions to Python and Django, we have also contributed to a variety of other open source projects, such as Redis, PostgreSQL, and more.

### **Conclusion**

At Fortytwo, we are committed to the open source philosophy and to contributing to open source projects and communities. Our rigorous code management process and our active involvement in open source projects help us build better software and give back to the technology community.

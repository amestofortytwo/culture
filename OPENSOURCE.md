# Open Source

We value honesty, transparency and sharing. These values are all part of the Open Source Software (OSS) community, a community that we all depend on to build our products and services. This document contains our OSS strategy and a summary of our prioritized community efforts.

1. If our code has no sensitive information (of any sort), there are no reason for it to be private.
2. We strive to promote and contribute to the Open Source projects that we use.
3. Amesto Fortytwo encourages our employees to get involved in Open Source, either by contributing code or time.

## Active contributions

>This is a work in progress, more information will be added soon.

### CNCF

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has been one of the major drivers of innovation in Cloud Native and Open Source. The most notable project hosted by the CNCF is the Kubernetes Project, but now is the home of over 150 projects, many of which we use daily like Prometheus, Flux, Flagger, cert-manager, linkerd, and so many more. You can read more about the foundation at [cncf.io](https://www.cncf.io/).

We are also supporting the CNCF as a member organization.

#### TAG App Delivery

There are several Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) at the CNCF, which serves as a forum for domain specific talks, and sponsors projects related to the TAG. We have mainly been working with TAG App Delivery, which focuses mostly on operations and platform engineering.

#### OpenGitOps

OpenGitOps is a project under TAG App Delivery. It is a bit unique, as it is not a software project in itself. OpenGitOps aims to help educate and promote GitOps, starting out with the GitOps principles that defines what should be considered GitOps, hosting events and conferences, and much more.

#### Platforms Working Group

As Platform Engineering is gaining popularity, the Platforms Working Group was created to help define what a platform is, and document patterns and explore trends.

### OpenSSF

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is one of the most important initiatives in recent time. We all consume open source software, but can we blindly trust what we find online? The idea behind the OpenSSF is to build a strong community around securing everything around open source, from build to consume. You can read more details on the foundation at [openssf.org](https://openssf.org/).

We are still very new to the OpenSSF, but we try to be as active as possible. For now, we have predominantely active in the End User and the Best Practices for OSS Developers working group. We also support OpenSSF by being a member of the organization.

### Cloud Native Norway

Cloud Native Norway is a non-profit organisation, co-founded by Roberth Strand from Amesto Fortytwo. The organisation aims to build a stronger community around cloud native technology and open source, through conferences, events, and by offering tools and guidance to others that want to help with the community.
